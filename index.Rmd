MI².AI is a group of mathematicians and computer scientists that love to play with predictive models.
We are spread between [Warsaw University of Technology](https://www.pw.edu.pl/engpw) and [University of Warsaw](https://en.uw.edu.pl). Here we have workshops, seminars, here we are forging new ideas, creating tools, solving problems, doing consulting and sharing our positive attitude. Feel free to jump in. 

#### Mission {-}

Machine learning is like atomic energy. **We develop leaders, skills, methods, tools and good practices so that predictive models can be deployed responsibly and sustainably**.

#### Vision {-}

MI² is a group of experts supporting global initiatives aimed at responsible and sustainable machine learning. We support the development of future leaders of responsible machine learning through internships, PhDs, postdoctoral fellowships and so on. We seek for research grants and business projects to conduct both scientific and applied research. We develop and maintain software and infrastructure necessary to build responsible and sustainable ML. We develop cooperation with international teams working on similar topics. We support companies to implement best practices related to responsible modelling in their operation. We conduct workshops and training on responsible predictive modelling.

### PhD positions in 2023 {-}

<img src="images/redteaming_mi2.png" style="width: 100%;">

**Call for PhD Student: Research Opportunity in Foundation Model Redteaming**

We are seeking a highly motivated and talented PhD student to join MI2.AI research team in the exciting field of foundation model redteaming. As the advancements development of AI models (especially transformer based with attention mechanism), it becomes crucial to ensure the robustness and security of the foundation models that underlie these advancements.

**Project Description:**

The selected PhD student will work on investigating potential vulnerabilities and biases in foundation models, such as language models (one PhD position) and 2D/3D computer vision models (one PhD position). Redteaming involves conducting adversarial assessments to identify weaknesses, uncover potential attack vectors, and develop defensive strategies for foundation models/transformer models. The research will explore various aspects, including data poisoning attacks, adversarial samples generation, and the development of countermeasures.

**Requirements:**

Proficiency in programming languages commonly used in AI research, such as Python, R or Julia.
Familiarity with deep learning frameworks and libraries, such as PyTorch.
Solid understanding of foundation models, including their architecture and training processes.
Excellent problem-solving skills and ability to work independently and as part of a team.
Good communication skills and proficiency in academic writing.


Interested candidates are requested to submit the following documents to **przemyslaw.biecek at pw.edu.pl**.


We look forward to receiving your applications and welcoming an enthusiastic and dedicated PhD student to contribute to our foundation model redteaming research endeavors.


Apply before **June 30 the end of the day** (**June 10 in case of interest in MIM UW**).

### Post-doc {-}
  
I am looking for a post-doc to join the MI2.AI team for one or two years within [HOMER](https://www.mi2.ai/research-grants.html#homer-2020-2025) project.
The ideal fit is someone with (experience in Medical Image Analysis with deep learning models) OR (someone with experience in AutoML for tabular data).
Experience or interest in **XAI** / **fairness** will always be a huge plus in our team.

We have a young and very energetic team focused on growth in AI. Full time position. Salary above academic average. Little or no didactics. Strong focus on doing things that are **meaningful**.

**Required:**

* PhD in Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics or similar. (Different background? We encourage cross-domain short research visits).
* Experience in Scientific Programming (R and/or Python and/or C++)
* Good track of Scientific Records

**Scope of work:**

* Automated model exploration
* Interpretable measures for model performance
* Meta/transfer learning in automated model development
* Automated model validation
* Experiments with XAI for deep learning

**Offer:**

* Excellent atmosphere for work in a young and very active ML lab
* Conferences and training budget
* Short visits in cooperating abroad group
* Access to CPU / GPU clusters
* Full-time job at Warsaw University of Technology
* plus results-driven extras
* contract for 6 months (short visit) / 12 months or 24 months (long visit)

<!-- ### ARES {-}

PhD position funded by the PRELUDIUM BIS grant ARES (*Attack-Resistant Explanations toward Secure and trustworthy AI*).

Machine learning explainability, fairness, robustness, and security are critical elements of trustworthy Artificial Intelligence, an area of strategic importance. The main goals:

* develop adversarial attacks on state-of-the-art explanations to investigate  vulnerabilities and limitations of the existing explainability and fairness approaches  in machine learning, and
* introduce novel robust explanations that are stable against manipulation and intuitive to evaluate.

These are targeted at progressing responsible machine learning toward a secure and trustworthy adoption of AI solutions. 

**Join us, and change the way how ML models will be explained and evaluated.**
